###This SQL query reads creates a series of temp tables to add gender contribution data to the main contribution data table
###It then runs a query on the months most recently entered to generate a CSV for addition to the R datafile
###
###Don't forget to convert Tanzania, Macedonia and Moldova to remove commas
###Format CSV file and add to end of gender in main database
###columns should conform to date,dateString,gcc,tccIso3Alpha,tccIso3Num,mission
